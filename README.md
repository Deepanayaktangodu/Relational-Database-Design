**Relational Database Design**
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database using SQL Server. It involves converting a relational design into tables, defining relationships, and ensuring data integrity with primary and foreign keys.

**Description**
The project focuses on:
•	Creating tables to represent entities such as users, roles, and account statuses.
•	Establishing relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
•	Populating tables with sample data (at least two rows per table).
•	Deleting data while preserving the structure and relationships.

**Key Features**
1.	Database normalization through relational design principles.
2.	Use of SQL Server to implement tables and constraints.
3.	Demonstrates operations like data insertion and deletion.

**How to Use**
1.	Download or clone the repository.
2.	Execute the provided .sql file in SQL Server Management Studio.
3.	Follow the comments in the code for guidance on creating tables, inserting data, and performing operations.

**Skills and Technologies Used**
•	Relational Database Design
•	SQL Server
•	Database Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key)

**Credits**
This project is part of the SQL Certification Training provided by Intellipaat.
